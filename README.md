## REWART
A customer loyalty rewards app where the user would get rewarded loyalty points based on the good practices he performed like saving water,electricity and proper disposal of garbage. We made use of hyperledger fabric. We made use of the IBM Blockchain extension on VSCode to install and instantiate our smart contract.
Finally we made use of flutter to create a mobile application so that a user can access his/her dashboard to spend and collect points based on the practices he/she performed.
